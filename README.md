# Students Academic Performance Analysis

## Introduction

Academic performance is influenced by multiple factors, but two of the most commonly discussed are class attendance and time spent studying. Schools often assume that higher attendance naturally leads to better results, yet real-world data sometimes tells a more nuanced story.

This project analyzes how attendance percentage, study hours, and previous academic performance influence students’ exam scores and grades. The objective is to uncover actionable insights that schools can use to improve academic outcomes through data-driven interventions.

The analysis highlights that while attendance and study time are important, quality of engagement and study strategies play a critical role in determining student success.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains academic records for 200 students, with the following attributes:

_student_id_, _attendance_percent_, _hours_studied_, _sleep_hours_, _previous_scores_, _exam_score_, _exam_grade_

Each record represents a student’s academic behavior and performance within a given assessment period.

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- Data Cleaning & Exploration
- Descriptive Analytics
- Performance Segmentation
- Educational Data Analysis
- Insight Generation & Reporting

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted using exploratory and descriptive analytics, including:

- Grouping students by attendance percentage ranges (50–60%, 60–70%, 70–80%, 80–90%, 90–100%)
- Identifying best and least performing students within each group
- Examining the relationship between study hours and exam scores
- Analyzing grade distributions across attendance bands
- Comparing previous academic performance with current outcomes

This approach enabled pattern discovery without assuming direct causation.

## Visualization and Analysis

### 1. Best-Performing Students

High-performing students were identified across all attendance ranges, with top exam scores ranging from 46 to 51.3. This suggests that strong performance is achievable even without perfect attendance, provided effective study habits are in place.

### 2. Least-Performing Students

Low-performing students were present in every attendance group, including those with 80–90% attendance. This indicates that attendance alone does not guarantee academic success.

### 3. Study Hours and Performance

Students with the strongest outcomes typically studied 11–12 hours on average, while students with poor results often studied 1–2 hours. However, score variation among high study-hour students shows that study quality matters as much as study duration.

### 4. Attendance vs Exam Grades

Across all attendance bands, the majority of students received “D” and “E” grades. Even students with high attendance frequently fell into lower grade categories, pointing to gaps in engagement or comprehension.

### 5. Grade Distribution Patterns

Very few students achieved “A” grades, regardless of attendance level. Most clustered in mid-to-low grade bands, suggesting a systemic performance challenge rather than isolated cases.

### 6. Attendance and Previous Academic Performance

Students with strong previous grades (“A” and “B”) were distributed across all attendance levels. Some experienced performance decline, indicating that prior success does not automatically translate into sustained performance.

### 7. Relationship Between Study Hours and Exam Scores

The highest exam scores consistently appeared within the 11–12 study-hour range, with the top score (51.3) recorded at 12 hours. Still, score variation confirms the importance of effective study techniques.

## Recommendations

1. Encourage Effective Study Routines: 
Promote structured study plans targeting 8–12 focused hours per week.

2. Peer Mentorship Programs: 
Engage high-performing students as mentors to share effective study strategies.

3. Early Intervention Systems: 
Identify and support students with low study hours or declining performance early.

4. Improve Classroom Engagement:
Adopt interactive and student-centered teaching approaches to complement attendance.

5. Targeted Remedial Support:
Provide tutorials and academic support for students clustered in “D” and “E” grade bands.

6. Holistic Performance Tracking: 
Monitor attendance, study habits, and academic performance together for better decision-making.

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that student performance is influenced by a combination of attendance, study habits, and engagement quality. While higher attendance and longer study hours generally improve outcomes, they are not sufficient on their own.

By leveraging data-driven monitoring, targeted interventions, and effective learning strategies, schools can significantly improve overall academic performance and reduce the concentration of low grades.
